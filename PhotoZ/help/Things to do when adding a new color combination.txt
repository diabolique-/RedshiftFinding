Things to do when adding a new color combination.

This code currently supports r-z...

To add new ones, here are the things that need to be done.

put filter curves in the ezgal directory for filters, if they aren't default filters
add the filter data to the filters.txt file
add the filter and its color combinations to the config_data.py file, following the examples already there

add a way for the code to read in the catalogs
	do that in the function read_sex_catalogs() in read_in_catalogs.py
	look at the already existing pathways to see the best way to go
add a way for it to determine the name of the clusters
